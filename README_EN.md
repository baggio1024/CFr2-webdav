### Passkey Passwordless Login (Optional)

- **Biometric Authentication** - Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello
- **Hardware Keys** - YubiKey, Titan Key, and other FIDO2 security keys
- **Phishing-Resistant** - Credentials bound to your domain, unusable on fake sites
- **Multi-Device Support** - Register multiple authenticators
- **WebAuthn Standard** - Compliant with W3C Web Authentication API

For detailed security configuration, see [Security Setup Guide](docs/SECURITY_SETUP.md).

## Quick Deployment

Choose one deployment method to get started:

### Method 1: One-Click Deploy (Easiest)

Ideal for quick trials and personal use.

1. Click the button below to start deployment:

   [![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/amm10090/CFr2-webdav)

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete deployment
3. See [Security Setup Guide](docs/SECURITY_SETUP.md) to configure password and security features

**Note**: Requires a Cloudflare account. If you don't have one, register for free at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com).

### Method 2: GitHub Actions Auto-Deploy (Recommended)

Ideal for version control and team collaboration scenarios.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Create a Cloudflare account** (if you don't have one)
3. **Create an R2 bucket**:
   - Log in to Cloudflare Dashboard
   - Go to R2 → Create bucket
   - Enter bucket name (e.g., `my-webdav-storage`)

4. **Create KV namespaces** (for storing authentication and rate limiting data):

   Use Wrangler CLI or create in Cloudflare Dashboard:

   ```bash
   # Using Wrangler CLI (recommended)
   npx wrangler kv:namespace create "RATE_LIMIT_KV"
   npx wrangler kv:namespace create "QUOTA_KV"
   npx wrangler kv:namespace create "TOTP_KV"
   ```

   Record each namespace ID for later configuration in GitHub Secrets.

5. **Generate password hash and JWT secret**:

   ```bash
   # Clone repository locally
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CFr2-webdav.git
   cd CFr2-webdav

   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Generate password hash (replace your-password with your password)
   node -e "
   const crypto = require('crypto');
   const password = 'your-password';
   const salt = crypto.randomBytes(16);
   const iterations = 100000;
   crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, 32, 'sha256', (err, derivedKey) => {
     if (err) throw err;
     console.log('PASSWORD_HASH=v1:' + iterations + ':' + salt.toString('base64') + ':' + derivedKey.toString('base64'));
   });
   "

   # Generate JWT secret
   node -e "console.log('JWT_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'));"
   ```

6. **Get Cloudflare API Token**:
   - Visit [Cloudflare API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
   - Click "Create Token"
   - Use "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template
   - Permissions:
     - Account → Cloudflare Workers Scripts → Edit
     - Account → Account Settings → Read
   - Copy token after creation (shown only once)

7. **Get Cloudflare Account ID**:
   - Log in to Cloudflare Dashboard
   - Find Account ID in the right sidebar

#### Configure GitHub Secrets

In your forked repository: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

Add the following Secrets (all required):

| Secret Name | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | API Token | `abc123...` |

     -d '{"username":"admin","password":"your-password"}'

   # If 2FA is needed, returns partialToken, then verify:
   curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/auth/2fa/verify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"partialToken":"PARTIAL_TOKEN","code":"123456"}'
   ```

2. Use returned `accessToken` as password (some clients support this)

### Security Features Setup

#### Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

1. **Preparation**:
   - Install authenticator app on your phone (recommended: Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator)

2. **Enable 2FA**:
   ```bash
   # Initiate setup request (requires login to get accessToken first)
   curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/auth/2fa/setup \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
   ```

   Returns:
   ```json
   {
     "secret": "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP",
     "qrCodeUrl": "otpauth://totp/CFr2-WebDAV:admin?secret=...",
     "recoveryCodes": ["A3B2C-5D7F1", "F1E8D-9A42B", ...]
   }
   ```

3. **Add to authenticator app**:
   - Open authenticator app
   - Scan QR code (generate using `qrCodeUrl`)
   - Or manually enter `secret`

4. **Verify and enable**:
   ```bash
   # Enter 6-digit code displayed by authenticator
   curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/auth/2fa/verify-setup \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"code":"123456"}'
   ```

5. **Save recovery codes**:
   - Print or save `recoveryCodes` in a secure location
   - Each recovery code can only be used once
   - Use recovery codes to login if you lose your phone

#### Setup Passkey Passwordless Login

**Prerequisites**:
- Modern browser with WebAuthn support (Chrome 67+, Firefox 60+, Safari 13+, Edge 18+)
- Device with biometric support (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) or FIDO2 security key

**Steps**:

1. **Login to Web interface** (using password or password+2FA)

2. **Register Passkey**:
   - Find "Security Settings" or "Passkey Management" in Web interface
   - Click "Add Passkey"
   - Browser prompts to choose authentication method:
     - "This device" (biometric)
     - "USB security key"
     - "iPhone/iPad/Android phone" (cross-device)
   - Complete authentication as prompted
   - Give your Passkey a name (e.g., "My iPhone")

3. **Test Passkey login**:
   - Log out
   - On login page, click "Login with Passkey"
   - Enter username
   - Verify with biometric or security key
   - Login without entering password

4. **Manage Passkeys**:
   - Can register multiple Passkeys (different devices)
   - View all registered Passkeys in Web interface
   - Can delete Passkeys no longer in use

**API Method Registration** (Advanced users):

See [Security Setup Guide](docs/SECURITY_SETUP.md#stage-3-webauthn-passkeys-) for detailed API call flow.

#### Disable 2FA

If you need to disable two-factor authentication:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/auth/2fa/disable \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password":"your-password"}'
```

**Warning**: Disabling 2FA reduces account security.

#### Regenerate Recovery Codes

If recovery codes are used up or lost:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/auth/2fa/recovery-codes/regenerate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password":"your-password"}'
```

## FAQ

### Deployment

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Can't access after deployment, showing 404 or 500 error?</strong></summary>

**Possible causes**:
1. Worker deployment failed
2. R2 bucket name configured incorrectly
3. KV namespace IDs incorrect

**Solutions**:
1. Check GitHub Actions deployment logs to confirm successful deployment
2. Verify in Cloudflare Dashboard:
   - Workers & Pages → Find your Worker → Check if deployed successfully
   - R2 → Confirm bucket exists and name matches configuration
   - KV → Confirm all three namespaces created
3. Check if configuration in wrangler.toml or GitHub Secrets is correct

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How to update Worker URL?</strong></summary>

After deployment, need to update `WORKER_URL` configuration:

1. Get actual Worker URL (in Cloudflare Dashboard or deployment logs)
2. **If using one-click deploy**:
   - In Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers → Your Worker → Settings → Variables
   - Modify `WORKER_URL` environment variable

3. **If using GitHub Actions**:
   - Update GitHub Secret `WORKER_URL`
   - Re-run deployment workflow

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Can I bind a custom domain?</strong></summary>

Yes. In Cloudflare Dashboard:

1. Workers & Pages → Your Worker → Settings → Triggers
2. Custom Domains → Add Custom Domain
3. Enter your domain (must be hosted on Cloudflare)
4. Update `WORKER_URL` environment variable to new domain

</details>

### Usage

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Windows File Explorer fails to connect to WebDAV?</strong></summary>

Windows doesn't support non-HTTPS WebDAV by default and is sensitive to certain configurations.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure using HTTPS (Cloudflare Workers provides by default)
2. URL must end with `/webdav/`
3. Recommend using RaiDrive or Cyberduck instead of built-in functionality
4. If must use built-in:
   - Enable WebClient service
   - Allow basic authentication in registry (testing only)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Large file upload fails?</strong></summary>

**Reasons**:
- Exceeds configured single file size limit (default 100MB)
- Cloudflare Workers request time limit (free tier 30 seconds, paid tier 15 minutes)

**Solutions**:
1. Adjust `MAX_FILE_SIZE` environment variable
2. For large files (> 100MB):
   - Consider using Cloudflare Workers Paid Plan
   - Or use clients that support chunked upload
3. Upload multiple small files in batches

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How to increase storage quota?</strong></summary>

Default quota is 10GB, can be adjusted:

1. Modify `STORAGE_QUOTA` environment variable (unit: bytes)
2. For example, set to 50GB: `STORAGE_QUOTA=53687091200`
3. Note Cloudflare R2 free tier limits:
   - Storage: 10 GB/month (free)
   - Class A operations: 1 million/month (free)
   - Class B operations: 10 million/month (free)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Forgot password?</strong></summary>

Need to regenerate password hash and update configuration:

1. Use commands in [deployment steps](#method-2-github-actions-auto-deploy-recommended) to generate new `PASSWORD_HASH`
2. Update environment variable:
   - **One-click deploy**: Update in Cloudflare Dashboard
   - **GitHub Actions**: Update GitHub Secret and redeploy
3. New password takes effect immediately

</details>

### Security

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Lost 2FA authenticator, can't login?</strong></summary>

Use recovery code to login:

1. On login page, enter username and password
2. At 2FA code prompt, enter recovery code (e.g., `A3B2C-5D7F1`)
3. After login, recommend:
   - Disable old 2FA configuration
   - Re-setup 2FA
   - Save new recovery codes

If recovery codes also lost, can only reset KV namespace to clear 2FA configuration (will lose all 2FA and Passkey data).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Passkey login fails?</strong></summary>

**Possible causes**:
1. Browser doesn't support WebAuthn
2. Using different domain (Passkey bound to domain)
3. Device or browser doesn't have registered Passkey

**Solutions**:
1. Confirm browser supports WebAuthn (check [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/webauthn))
2. Ensure accessing same domain as when Passkey was registered
3. If Passkey unavailable, use password login
4. Re-register new Passkey

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How to view login logs and suspicious activity?</strong></summary>

In Cloudflare Dashboard:

1. Workers & Pages → Your Worker → Logs
2. Select "Real-time Logs" to view live logs
3. Pay attention to:
   - Failed login attempts
   - Rate-limited IP addresses
   - 2FA verification failures

Paid users can use Logpush to export logs to external systems for analysis.

</details>

### Performance

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Slow file download speed?</strong></summary>

**Possible causes**:
- Geographic distance from R2 bucket is far
- Network issues

**Optimization methods**:
1. Cloudflare R2 automatically uses global edge network for acceleration
2. For large files, consider:
   - Enable Cloudflare CDN caching
   - Use R2 public URL (if authentication not needed)
3. Check local network connection

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Worker request timeout?</strong></summary>

Free tier Cloudflare Workers has 30-second CPU time limit.

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce file size for single operations
2. Upgrade to Workers Paid Plan (CPU time limit increased to 15 minutes)
3. For listing many files, use pagination

</details>

### Other

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Can multiple people use it?</strong></summary>

Current version only supports single user (one username/password).

For multi-user support:
- Deploy separate Worker instance for each user
- Or consider forking the project and implementing multi-user functionality

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Is data secure? Can Cloudflare access it?</strong></summary>

**Data security guarantees**:
1. Passwords stored using PBKDF2 hash, even if database leaks, original password cannot be recovered
2. JWT tokens signed with HMAC-SHA256, cannot be forged
3. All transmissions use HTTPS encryption

**Cloudflare access**:
- Cloudflare as infrastructure provider theoretically can access data stored in R2
- But Cloudflare's privacy policy promises not to view user data
- If end-to-end encryption needed, recommend encrypting files on client before upload

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How to backup data?</strong></summary>

**Method 1: Using WebDAV client**
- Connect to WebDAV
- Copy all files to local

**Method 2: Using Cloudflare API**
```bash
# Use rclone to sync R2 data
rclone sync r2:my-bucket /local/backup
```

**Method 3: R2 snapshots** (paid feature)
- Cloudflare R2 supports object versioning (need to enable in bucket settings)

Recommend backing up important data regularly.

</details>

## Local Development

If you need to modify code or test locally:

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- Cloudflare account (for connecting to R2 and KV during local development)

### Development Steps

1. **Clone repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amm10090/CFr2-webdav.git
   cd CFr2-webdav
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure wrangler.toml**:
   ```bash
   cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
   # Edit wrangler.toml, fill in your configuration
   ```

4. **Local development**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:8787` to test

5. **Deploy to Cloudflare**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Notes

- Don't commit `wrangler.toml` with real credentials to Git
- `wrangler.toml` already excluded in `.gitignore`
- Local development uses Cloudflare's remote R2 and KV (need to configure bindings)
